<h1><strong>Port of Colón Multi-Week Analysis</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>Executive Summary</strong></h2>

Analyzed the Port of Colón’s connectivity, infrastructure capacity, technological adoption, and sustainability performance using multi-week presentations and a full research report. The project assessed how the port maintains competitiveness as a major Caribbean transshipment hub.

<h2><strong>Business Problems</strong></h2>

Evaluate whether the Port of Colón is operationally ready for future growth amid increasing vessel sizes, sustainability requirements, and competition from regional ports.

<h2><strong>Key Questions</strong></h2>

•⁠  ⁠How strong is Colón’s global and inland connectivity?  
•⁠  ⁠Can the port handle modern vessel sizes and rising throughput?  
•⁠  ⁠How much do PORTCEL & CICO improve speed and efficiency?  
•⁠  ⁠Is the port advancing sustainably and competitively?

<h2><strong>Methodology</strong></h2>

•⁠  ⁠Reviewed TEU throughput, vessel capacity, berth depth, and layout.  
•⁠  ⁠Assessed digital systems (PORTCEL, CICO) and their impact on clearance and turnaround time.  
•⁠  ⁠Evaluated environmental, economic, and social sustainability factors.  
•⁠  ⁠Compared Colón with Cartagena across TEU volume, cost, and technology.

## My Contribution

- Collected and structured data on TEU throughput, vessel capacity, berth depth, and yard layout from public port statistics and industry reports.  
- Built the main Excel tables and charts used in the analysis (throughput trends, vessel size vs. berth depth, Cartagena vs. Colón comparison).  
- Helped shape the comparison framework between Colón and Cartagena by focusing on connectivity, cost, and technology.  
- Drafted parts of the written report, especially the sections on connectivity and digital systems (PORTCEL, CICO) and how they affect clearance time and efficiency.  
- Designed and updated several weekly PowerPoint slides so that key findings and visuals were clear and easy to present.  
- Presented parts of the analysis in class, explaining our approach and answering follow-up questions from the lecturer and classmates.
